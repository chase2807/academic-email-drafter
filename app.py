    **Note on Direct Sending:** Actual email sending functionality (e.g., using `smtplib` in Python) is not implemented in this web demo.
    Implementing direct email sending would require:
    1.  Secure handling of your email credentials (username, password, or app-specific passwords).
    2.  Configuration of SMTP server details (e.g., for Gmail, Outlook, or your institutional email).
    3.  Careful error handling and security considerations to protect your information.
    This is typically done in a backend system or a local application where you can securely manage such sensitive data.
